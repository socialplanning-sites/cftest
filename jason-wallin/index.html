<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%"><u>Abstract</u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%">The <i>Black Metal </i>subgenre
emerged in the early 1980&#8217;s, deviating from rhythmically aggressive <i>thrash
metal</i> in lieu of more stylized (Wagnerian) Classical and pagan referents.
Since its &#8216;Second Wave&#8217; of stylistic development (starting in 1990), this<i> </i>subgenre
has garnered attention in the media for its ostensible negative impact upon
contemporary youth. Beginning in the early 1990&#8217;s, proponents of the <i>Black
Metal</i> movement have been associated with acts of church burning, satanic
worship, murder, and ritual suicide. Such actions have circulated under the
signifier of &#8216;evil,&#8217; and have in numerous cases been associated with
anti-Christian symbology and pagan practices. Contemporary media and moralizing
political pundits have quickly positioned such acts of &#8216;evil&#8217; beyond rational
comprehension via the deployment of  &#8216;a rhetoric of evil.&#8217; This enframement has
evaded the psychoanalytic &#8216;question of evil&#8217; and the significant role of negative
ethics in theorizing the allure and potential impact of <i>Black Metal </i>music.
Drawing upon Zizek&#8217;s development of &#8216;evil&#8217; through Lacan&#8217;s three registers,
this essay attempts to tease out alternate readings of &#8216;evil&#8217; through a
detailed analysis of  <i>Black Metal </i>music and practice,  rehabilitating
the complex corridors of &#8216;evil&#8217; against its conceptual collapse as merely the
ontological &#8216;absence of good.&#8217; Further, via Zizek, I offer  a reconsideration
of the seemingly anti-establishment terrorist activities enacted by some
proponents of <i>Black Metal </i>ideology. Herein, I will attempt to deploy a
reading of &#8216;ideological evil&#8217; in order to interrogate the role of enjoyment and
desire at work in the <i>Black Metal </i>musical subgenre. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%"><u>The Psychoanalytic Question of
Evil and the Influence of  Black Metal Music on Youth.</u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%">            Throughout the late
1990s, a series of church burnings, murders, and suicides focused world
attention on Norway and, in particular, on the now infamous &#8216;Black Metal&#8217;
musical sub-culture that emerged across Scandinavia and has since proliferated
worldwide. Extending from such musical referents as Venom, Celtic Frost, and
Bathory in the 1980&#8217;s, the reinvigorated Norwegian Black Metal of the 1990s
bears critical differences. While previous Black Metal groups were ostensible
extensions of the horror entertainment industry, the &#8216;second wave&#8217; of Black
Metal was marked by a transgressivity and excess collapsing the supposed
differentiation of fantasy and reality. To the vehement concern of Western
authorities, the Black Metal &#8216;act&#8217; was no longer being limited to the stage. Of
greater anxiety was the seeming disappearance of the dividing line between the
&#8216;act&#8217; and &#8216;reality,&#8217; &#8220;fa&#231;ade&#8221; and &#8220;authenticity.This anxiety coalesced
throughout the period from 1992 to 1996, when over fifty Norwegian church
arsons were attempted. When Norwegian Skjold, Asane, and Fantoft stave church
were razed, Black Metal figure Varg Vikernes<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[i]</span></span></span></a>,
better known within the Black Metal milieu as Count Grishnackh, was directly
implicated. Fear of repeat arsons was  elevated when an image of the ruined
church appeared on  the cover of  Vikernes&#8217; band Burzum&#8217;s album <i>Aske</i> (<i>Ashes</i>)<span style="line-height:200%">. While both the media and authorities hystericized
the arson as an act of irrationality, mental illness, and spiritual evil, a
latent fear lingered that such acts were ideologically motivated . Another
paradoxical specter also remained. In a country ranked number one on the United
Nations&#8217; human development index, the emergence of Norwegian Black Metal and
its significant youth following posed a perplexing issue that would be neither remedied
nor ignored. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%"><u><span style="line-height:200%">On
the Plains of Gorgoroth</span></u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">Media attention significantly reinvigorated public
fears in 2004 when Black Metal group Gorgoroth gained media infamy in Poland
for the extreme sacrilegious and horrific scene of a live show in the capital
city of Krakow. Extending the phantasmagoria of stark pagan and Satanic imagery
to the point of their collapse with the Lacanian Real -- that is, the traumatic
and excessive character of the unconscious --     They depicted blood-drenched
figures attached to crucifixes, adjacent to a row of impaled animal heads, set
against an apocalyptic backdrop reminiscent of Tolkien&#8217;s Mordor. The show
transgressed the borderlines of the stage, leading one of the camera operators
to note in an interview for the Polish media outlet &#8216;Fakty&#8217;: &#8220;We weren&#8217;t just
repulsed, we were horrified. A number of major Polish publishers devoted the
cover of their newspapers to this grotesque scene, capturing Gorgoroth&#8217;stransgressive
overflowing, merging, and destabilization of orthodox boundaries (cf. Connelly,
2003 the scene played at what Badiou (2001) has dubbed &#8220;the passion for the Real,&#8221;
that is, a 20<sup>th</sup> century symptom seeking  experience unmediated by
the Symbolic register of language and law, &#8220;</span><span style="line-height:
200%">the Real in its extreme violence as the price to be paid for peeling off
the deceiving layers of reality&#8221;</span><span style="line-height:200%"> (Zizek,
2002, pp. 5-6). The sadistic image of Gorgoroth&#8217;s live show seemed to confirm
the antagonism of repressed life, particularly so in its Polish Catholic
context, wherein the iconography of Black Metal staged a direct affront to
popular belief and identity, directly inverting the symbols of &#8216;goodness&#8217; and
&#8216;godliness&#8217; into their most profane de-formations.   </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">While Gorgoroth&#8217;s performance marks an eruption of the
repressed, excessive, and traumatic life of the Real, such phantasmagoria still
remain intimately bound to the Lacanian Imaginary, to fantasy and the semiotic.
As Zizek (2002a) avers, because the pure Real cannot be extracted from a
reality that already evades being &#8216;pinned down,&#8217; the opposite effect transpires
as an &#8220;obsession with pure appearance&#8221; (Zizek, 2002b). Because there is no
Symbolic position from which we might articulate the kernel of the Real, or
rather, because the Real resists symbolization in the differential system of
language, the Imaginary fills in for this lack in representation. The Poland
Newspaper Metro closed in on this scene and expressively activated its image as
&#8220;Satan on Stage.&#8221; The context here is germane. The scenes of Gorgoroth&#8217;s live
show in the Royal Capital City  of Poland shocked an overwhelmingly Roman Catholic
audience into upset and fear. Staging the ruin of  Roman Catholic symbology and,
as with many heavy metal bands, performing the apocalyptic moment as an
escalation of violence and transgression, Gorgoroth&#8217;s performance was dubbed
terroristic and &#8216;fundamentally&#8217; evil. While the crew filming the performance
had previously worked with such extreme heavy metal acts as Cannibal Corpse,
Children of Bodom, and Anathema, they commented that they had never seen
anything as wild or raw as the Gorgoroth performance. As one commentator noted,</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&#8220;In these times of big money
contracts, pre-fabricated boy bands and girl groups hand </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> picked by a panel of TV judges, it&#8217;s
so easy to forget that </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> there are bands out there that are
the real deal &#8211; and Gorgoroth are definitely that. In</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> fact, with Gorgoroth you have to
wonder whether they are a little too real.&#8221; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in">(Uncredited, 2006)
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in">&#160;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">Polish
authorities were quick to confiscate the footage of the scene pending a full
scale investigation aimed at determining if Gorgoroth had broken a Polish law
restricting religious offence. Despite the dismissal of all charges, the
anxiety engendered by the Black Metal movement had returned in full force,
marking for many the return of Satanic evil incarnate. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">However,
this connection to Satanism was not new. Reporting on the church burningsof the
1990s, media outlets across Norway hystericized the connection to Satanism.
Tr&#248;rstein Grude&#8217;s 1998 documentary, <i>Satan Rir Media </i>(Satan Rides the
Media) demonstrates how the Norwegian and later world media quickly elevated
the Black Metal scene to the level of international recognition through the
evocation of Satanism. While Norwegian police expressed concern at dubbing the
Black Metal scene Satanic for lack of evidence, the term emerged daily in
Norwegian newspapers, on television and the radio (Grude, 1998). While largely
unsubstantiated, the interconnection of Black Metal to pure Satanic  evil was
profitable news- making.  </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">To name a thing evil, Badiou (2001/2002) claims, we
must already be subjectivized,  that is, we must already be located in the symbolic
order in a way through which a particular thing might be construed as &#8216;Evil.&#8217;
Of course, such a position is that of assuming one&#8217;s alignment with the
Symbolic &#8216;Good.&#8217;  Badiou extends this claim to articulate the political
apparatus along the structures &#8216;Good&#8217; and   &#8216;Evil.&#8217; Even though &#8220;our leaders
and propagandists know very well that liberal capitalism is an inegalitarian
regime, unjust, and unacceptable for the vast majority of humanity,&#8221; it is
better than living in &#8220;a condition of Evil&#8221; (Badiou, 2001/2002). For many,
Gorgoroth&#8217;s live show was a confirmation of this Pascalian wager: that  it is
better to believe in an ostensibly democratic and liberal society or religious
system than to risk its <i>Other</i>. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%"><u><span style="line-height:200%">Impossibility
and Necessity: Imaginary Interventions and the Real</span></u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%"> As Zupancic (2001) suggests, the Otherness of
subjectivity, the repressed and unconscious, returns as a conjunction of the <i>impossible</i>
and the <i>necessary</i>. In this vein, there is an intimate connection between
evil and the Imaginary. &#8220;The link between &#8216;evil&#8217; (in the common use of this
word) and the Imaginary springs from the fact that we are dealing with
something that has no image&#8221; (ibid.). In other words, because the Other resists
Symbolization, Imaginary intervention becomes a site of the <i>impossibility</i>

of capturing the pure Real but, also, as a mediating <i>necessity</i>. The lack
of subjectivity and its inability to directly articulate its psychic turmoil are
mediated through the Imaginary as a &#8220;face to some disturbing void beyond
representation&#8221; (ibid. ). As Bakhtin (1984) similarly elucidates, the
inexpressible lack of the Symbolic Order is supplemented by an embodied
carnivalesque body &#8220;that figures in all the expressions of the unofficial
speech of the people&#8221; (p. 318). </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">Zizek (1994b) demonstrates this function of the
Imaginary in his treatment of the specter of ideology. As he  contends, the
antagonism in society is often interpreted as constituted by the fundamental
antimony of complementary opposites. The antagonism staged in Gorgoroth&#8217;s
Krakow performance, then, was perhaps unsurprisingly disposed to be treated as
a conflict of &#8216;good&#8217; vs. &#8216;evil.&#8217; For Zizek, what is denied in this interpretive
move toward binaries is a spectral supplement that disrupts the ostensible
organic completeness of the binary pair. Apropos Schelling, Zizek points to
this excess beyond the binary pair as indicative of a ternary structure at
work. Not simply &#8216;good versus evil&#8217; then, but its supplemental folding in the
antihero, the corrupt bastion of truth, the ethical deceiver and deceived ethicist.
He  points out that this ideological specter supplements what the binary
pairing cannot symbolize. The spectral supplement is in this way a means of
coping with the antagonism of the Real, in effect making sense of non-sense.
Because this spectral supplement is unsymbolizable along the differential logic
of the binary pair, it relies heavily on Imaginary interventions and the
assemblages of seemingly incommensurate forms. Into the gap which evades symbolic
articulation floods the calculus of the Imaginary playing as close as it can to
an unrepresentable Real. Yet, as we close in to test the &#8216;reality&#8217; of these
Imaginary beachheads, the &#8216;passion for the Real&#8217; can become fatal.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%"><u><span style="line-height:200%">The
Anti-Christ and Black Metal</span></u><span style="line-height:200%"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%"> Perhaps here we might understand Gorgoroth as an
Imaginary representation for the unrepresentable antagonisms of religion,
class, and subjectivity. The violence articulated through Black Metal music
might be understood as </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">The
Black Metal movement shares a counter-position to Christianity;  Gorgoroth, in
particular, appropriates Nietzsche&#8217;s <i>The Anti-Christ</i> (1968) as an
assumption ofpower through Satan. The official Gorgorothweb site, for example,
deploys a fragment of Nietzsche as if a manifesto:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.7in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"> I call Christianity the one great
curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge,
for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and small
enough, - I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race (p.62).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.7in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&#160;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">This
position marks a deep seated antagonism over what some Norwegians understand as
the erasure of their heritage and identity by way of the interposition of
Evangelical Lutheranism. Nietzsche&#8217;s critique rails at the religious subject psychically
structured via the naturalization of &#8216;original sin,&#8217; &#8216;mercy,&#8217; &#8216;faith,&#8217; and &#8216;the
good.&#8217;  Nietzsche&#8217;s commentary on the religio-historical fabrication of the
subject points also to the sublimation of the will and agency through constant
deferral to  God as a psychic  Big Other. As Nietzsche suggests, &#8220;pagans are
all those who say yes to life, and to whom &#8216;God&#8217; is a word signifying
acquiescence in all things&#8221; (pp. 55-56). The connection between faith and
blessedness, Nietzsche avers, is premised not on a demonstration (you cannot
demonstrate blessedness) but a <i>promise</i>. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">This promise, &#8220;that one <i>shall </i>be blessed
because one believes,&#8221; pivots on an absurd non-sense element. Nietzsche
forwards the formula, &#8220;I believe that faith makes for blessedness &#8211; <i>therefore</i>
it is true&#8221; as an indication of the aporetic breach in the &#8216;leap of faith.&#8217;
This non-sense at the heart of truth, the &#8220;<i>therefore</i>,&#8221; can never be
delivered by the priest as pure Real, and in its place Nietzsche suggests,
floods a phantasmagoria of authoritative poses and  postures more captivating
than  reasons. Nietzsche (1968) writes, </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&#8220;under Christianity neither
morality nor religion has any point of contact with </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> actuality. It offers purely
imaginary <i>causes </i>(&#8216;God&#8217; &#8216;soul,&#8217; &#8216;ego,&#8217; &#8216;spirit,&#8217;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> &#8216;free will&#8217;--or even &#8216;unfree&#8217;),
and purely imaginary<i> effects </i>(&#8216;sin,&#8217; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&#8216;salvation,&#8217; &#8216;grace,&#8217; &#8216;punishment,&#8217;
&#8216;forgiveness of sins&#8217;&#8221; (p. 9). </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&#160;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">In
this sense, the semiotics deployed by the priest in this sense act to mediate
what cannot be fully presented, the pure Real of the <i>beyond</i> as a proof
of blessedness and pleasure. Of course, there is no empirical basis by which
blessedness or goodness could be founded (Zupancic, 2001). For many Black Metal
bands, the reliance on an excessive and carnivalesque semiology acts as a
similar attempt to Imagine the Real. This phantasmagoria is of course played
out with an essential difference in its Christian and Pagan renditions, one
that has perhaps been incorrectly, albeit strategically disclosed following the
binary opposition of good and evil.  </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">It is significant to note at this juncture that many
proponents of Norwegian Black Metal consider themselves Odalists rather than
Satanists, suggesting not only a spiritual, but national crisis at work within
the sub-culture. A principal way in which  Odalism is distinct from Satanismis its
 Social Nationalist connotations. . From the proto-Germanic <i>opalan</i> --  more
roughly, &#8216;heritage,&#8217; &#8216;homeland,&#8217; &#8216;fatherland&#8217; -- Odalism marks the exertion of
national pride by privileging a return to original geographical lineages,
ethnic knowledge and practices. It should be noted that many practitioners of
Odalism follow pagan beliefs on environmental protection, reviving narrative
tradition, and animism, though many of these movements do not condone
antagonism toward the Christian church. For many of its followers, Odalism
marks the Imaginary restoration of Teutonic genealogies in turn recuperating a nationalist
authenticity. While many Black Metal bands have directly divorced themselves
from or obscured their political affiliations, or practice a politic while
ignorant, other bands such as Burzum, Mayhem, and Gorgoroth have supported the
burning of Lutheran churches across Norway as a means of reviving Nordic
tradition and reinvigorating a nationalist <i>Ubermensch</i>. In this vein, the
relationship between Christianity and Nordic paganism cannot be overlooked. </span></p>

Tryggvason</span><span style="line-height:200%"> in 995 A.D saw the coastline
of Norway and its western islands inculcated under the sign of Christianity.
Pagan churches were razed while commissioned missionaries proliferated and
subjects were offered a choice between baptism and death. Norway was officially
converted then under Olaf I&#8217;s zealous rule. Yet, by this same time, Christian
symbology, ritual, and writing had already formed a strong cultural subtext.
Attempted conversion of Scandinavia can be traced as early as 725 A.D., when an
Anglo Saxon mission led by St. Willibrord was received diplomatically, but
failed to effect significant cultural  change. By 820 A.D., Frankish
missionaries led an ongoing agenda of conversion with the support of Emperor
Louis the Pious. During this period, worshippers of Odin and Christians alike
cohabited in the Viking city of Hadeby, during which such pagan symbols as
runes and Thor&#8217;s hammer circulated along with  the Christian cross as common
adornments. The presence of pagan and Christian graves are also
archaeologically evidenced prior to 995 A.D., as is  a currency circulated in
Viking York integrating pagan symbols such as Thor&#8217;s hammer with the name of
St. Peter. So where is the location of the &#8216;authentic&#8217; cultural moment that the
Odalists seek to recuperate? That is, if Viking and Christian communities,
rites, and symbols have co-existed economically and politically for hundreds of
years, what constitutes the Teutonic Folkish moment of authenticity? For Black
Metal proponents, Teutonic origins connote the period prior to Christian
conversion.  </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">Intimate to the recuperation of &#8216;cultural
authenticity&#8217; is the scene of the apocalyptic moment staged by such Black Metal
Bands as Gorgoroth. As Baudrillard (2003) comments re  our current cultural
condition, neoliberalism has induced a certain &#8216;limitlessness&#8217; of development
and production in which &#8220;the end can no longer be located&#8221; (p. 55). As Baudrillard
notes apropos Fukuyama, the fear is not that history will have an end, but
rather, that it will have no end, &#8220;and hence no longer any finality, any
purpose&#8221; (p. 57). &#8216;The End,&#8217; as Baudrillard suggests, marks such a point of finality
of both purpose and meaning. It is toward such an illusory end that the
apocalyptic moment of Black Metal is oriented, and through this, the
retroactive restoration of origins through which &#8220;the play of cause and effect
will be possible&#8221; (p. 57). Rather than extraditing the moment of Symbolic death
-- as we see in social attempts to escape age, control birth, and curtail the
onset of alternatives -- the Black Metal movement significantly centers on the
recuperation and deployment of death as a symbolization of time&#8217;s end (cf. Baudrillard,
2002). With such an end point put into play, the purpose of the Viking mythos
is not only rehabilitated, it is further connected to the Symbolic death of
Christian subjectivity, and in Black Metal, the birth of a new subjectivity that
 lacks nothing because of its proximity to an illusory original condition. In
this vein, Zizek (2002a) notes &#8220;</span><span style="line-height:200%">the

attracted to Black Metal as a form of symbolic resistance and individual
ascendancy (cited in Dunn, McFayden &amp; Wise, 2006). Contrary to the
passivity and bourgeois aspirations of the preceding generation, the Black
Metal movement advocates  subjective agency and  a vision of individuality precluded
from  acting <i>in</i> and <i>upon </i>the world. Further, the general malaise
of spiritual life under Christianity and consumerism has led many Black Metal
bands to embrace Viking mythopoetics, which &#8220;can perhaps be more personal
because [they have] not yet been appropriated by the establishment of [Western]
society&#8221;  (ibid.)  (). Viking mythological figures, Erikson notes, are
constituted by conflicted, unpredictable characterizations. They are neither
good or evil, but embody both good <i>and</i> evil. In this way, the Viking
mythologies  &#8220;are easier to identify with&#8221;, particularly in a world that seems
increasingly polarized and symbolically demarcated (ibid.).    ). </span></p>

Metal, Symbolic Castration, and the &#8216;Desert of the Real&#8217;</span></u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">The popularity of Black Metal speaks to a general
malaise that is also prevalent in North America, one that has reached its
extreme limits as both the mortification of the subject and  a &#8216;passion for the
Real&#8217; (Badiou, 2002).  It is obvious that Black Metal is not apathetic.
Seemingly, its lack of nihilism is one of its most frightening features in that
through  nihilism it might have been  rendered impotent and absorbed into
cynical culture. It  might rather be seen/scene as a symptom of the apathetic,
that is, of the subject cut off from his/her jouissance through the draining of
the Big Other&#8217;s desire.  For  many Black Metal bands, &#8216;acquiescence&#8217; to God as
a Big Other has ostensibly severed  subjects from their own will and pleasure.
Unable to provide a position from which the subject might address his/her own s  
Symbolic castration, institutional overregulation, and corollary alienation,
Black Metal perpetually eulogizes the cut, languidly playing out the moment of
madness intimate to the act of faith and, concomitantly, the constitution of
the subject. Such psychodrama is  evidenced in the form of Gorgoroth&#8217;s music
and through lead singer Gaahl&#8217;s vocals, which are more reminiscent of a
tortured primal scream than any attempt at languaged representation.
Functioning at the limit of the Symbolic and Real registers, between language
and primitive vocalization, Gaahl performs the castrating function of the
Symbolic cut, the immersion into an alienating language as a scream of
suffering and tortured resistance. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">Such resistance and suffering are  evidenced by those
Black Metal bands who employ &#8216;corpsepaint.&#8217; <a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1">As a representation of their status as dead or outsiders to
the Symbolic order, &#8216;corpsepaint&#8217; faces are a connotation of the resistance
performed by Black Metal performers and followers.</a> In an age of surface
aesthetics, extreme make-overs, and a general preoccupation with youthful
appearance, the &#8216;corpsepaint&#8217; face is a cracked, moribund, and sometimes
bloodied illustration of faciality in its decayed, most exposed figuration. Yet
beyond the mere theatricality of such facial decoration, &#8216;corpsepaint&#8217; is
connected to Viking folklore and, more specifically, to the fallen spirits of
the battlefield, Odin&#8217;s &#8216;Oskorei.&#8217; It is significant, then, that &#8216;corpsepaint&#8217;
is a reflection of having not only died in the Symbolic realm, but of the war
that <i>is </i>the Symbolic realm, the site where so many of today&#8217;s youth wage
an ongoing and often dire struggle for recognition, individuality, and
particularity. In this way, Black Metal audiences might find psychic comfort in
the Imaginary bodies of Gorgoroth. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">Clad in protruding spikes, ammunition belts, and
frequently photographed wielding medieval weapons, Black Metal bands such as
Gorgoroth portray the body as a war-machine --  untouchable, caustic, and yet
protected. This Imaginary body not only confers a sense of psychic and physical
power, prowess, and virility, it is also a body that wards against &#8216;being eaten
alive&#8217; by a Chronos like Symbolic apparatus. This anxiety over being consumed,
of being eaten alive, is very much a gendered castration anxiety. In this vein,
the hardening and sheathing of the male body in metal concomitantly creates &#8220;a
defense against culturally produced gender anxieties&#8221; (Walser, 1993, p. 116).
The masculine body displayed by such bands as Gorgoroth thus forms an Imaginary
screen for the controlled and mastered body prior to Symbolic castration. Yet,
somewhat paradoxically, this fantasy screen concomitantly acts as a display of
wildness and untamed virulence not yet domesticated by the law and societal
moral regulations. In this vein, it is significant to note that the Viking
Oskorei are not simply reserved to a position of death or passivity in waiting
to be consumed. In Norse mythology, the Oskorei are spirits of vengeance that
return to judge the judges and hunt the righteous. They are the repressed
energies and bodies that both haunt and demand indemnification, disinclined to
fade away like &#8216;good&#8217; ghosts are wont or made to do.  </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%"> Black Metal bands approach recording and production
from a raw and grainy perspective, imbuing the music with elemental, folk, and
dark overtones. This melancholic approach typical of Black Metal perhaps marks
the inability to fully mourn the lost object of the Real, the full intensities
of the body and the libidinal, elemental energy of a &#8216;raw life.&#8217;  It draws from
both epic orchestral forms, elevating the music to flights of transcendence, and
 languid atmospheric desolation, a musical variation  on what Zizek (2002b) has
dubbed &#8216;the desert of the Real,&#8217; a representation of life stripped of its
placating or obfuscating Symbolic veils. In this sense, Black Metal
demonstrates  Badiou&#8217;s  &#8216;passion for the Real&#8217; in constantly attempting to
evoke an &#8216;essential&#8217; form of evil. Even the name Gorgoroth refers to Tolkien&#8217;s
desolate wasteland north of Mordor, constituting yet another analogy to  the
&#8216;desert of the Real,&#8217; the void at the heart of the Symbolic Order. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">Zupancic (2001) poses the question of whether there is
an image of evil that can &#8216;fill in&#8217; the inability of the image to represent the
Real. In response, she hypothesizes an aspect of the Imaginary that  is not an
image but, instead, a way in which an image stands out as &#8220;an effect of the
Real on our imagination, the last veil or screen that separates us from the
impossible.&#8221;  This i   Image, she  suggests,  holds  a &#8220;special power of
fascination&#8221; or element of complexity afforded in part by its inability to  fully
Symbolize the Real. In other words, the &#8216;glow&#8217; of the Image is intimately
connected to a lack in the Symbolic Order, an inability to  provide a position
to the marginalized and, further, to account for the emergence of alternative
positions or repressed energies. Perhaps this too is an aspect of the &#8216;passion
for the Real,&#8217; wherein the Imaginary register becomes captured in an impetus to
reveal  all things secret, clandestine, and occult, that is, to bring all
&#8216;hidden&#8217; acts into purview, thus affording them what  Zupancic   calls   &#8220;aur,&#8221;
, &#8220;glow,&#8221;  and &#8220;shine.&#8221;    </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">Baudrillard, in his  <i>Passwords </i>(2003),  asks, given
the 20<sup>th</sup> century passion for the Real, &#8220;what happens to the things
once kept secret?&#8221; (p. 33). Obverse to visible exchange, Baudrillard notes that
&#8216;secrets&#8217; function to remove something from the visible order. Yet, in a world
that &#8220;tends toward the visible&#8221; what happens to such acts that often shared in
secret as part of an &#8220;invisible exchange&#8221; (ibid. ). The clandestine acts of
occult worship and ritual become, in this formulation, maleficent, and as such
are targeted for extermination as acts of ostensible &#8216;evil.&#8217;  Yet, as
Baudrillard suggests, the secret cannot be exterminated and, as such,  will
instead be diabolized and drawn out &#8220;through the very instruments used to
annihilate it&#8221; (ibid.) . As Debray comments on Debord&#8217;s society of the
spectacle, we are no longer in a societythat  creates a distance between
things, alienating the subject and object but, rather, &#8220;our curse is that we
have been brought up ultra-close against them&#8230;and this all-too real world is
obscene&#8221;   quoted in Baudrillard, 2003, p. 28). This notion of obscenity is in
part the perverse inversion of secrecy and seduction, in which  all exchange is
realized at increasingly minimized and fractal distances. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">Through obscenity and &#8220;the total visibility of things,&#8221;
the world is given to a transparency through which Imaginary and Real registers
collapse and bleed through one another in a manner akin to a Medieval
palimpsest. In this manner, it is perhaps more apt to speak not of transparency
but rather, of transpiration or &#8216;showing-through&#8217;.  In this 20<sup>th</sup>
century phase, we are forced, Baudrillard suggests, to employ the &#8220;fatal
strategies&#8221; of ambivalence, cynicism, and radical doubt lest &#8220;this particular
transparency&#8230;be totally lethal&#8221; (p. 29). In this vein, it is perhaps not
surprising to recognize how coverage of the Norwegian Black Metal movement
continues to be occupied by the question of whether it is &#8216;real&#8217; or a &#8216;fa&#231;ade,&#8217;
inciting disbelief and an attitude of cynicism as a psychic  beachhead
protecting one from the &#8220;irresolvable antagonism&#8221; of the obscene, an opposition
between good and evil for which &#8220;there is no possible reconciliation&#8221; (ibid.). 
 &#8220;Whatever laughter&#8221; such acts as Gorgoroth might elicit is  &#8220;conjoined with
feelings of repulsion and dread,&#8221; as an expression of the Symbolic lack and
antagonism they attempt to mediate (ibid., p. 10).  </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">In much of Black Metal, signs of the &#8216;Good&#8217; are
directly inverted. This inversion however, is not simply between the terms of
good and evil, but rather between the modes of existence expressed by the
signifiers &#8216;good&#8217; and &#8216;evil.&#8217;  In a literal sense, the &#8216;Goodly&#8217; figure of the
priest and altar, church,  sacrament, and holy text are inverted in Black Metal
iconography. The pious priest, servant to God, is opposed in the image of the
warrior cleric --  independent, willful, and aggressive. The church as a holy
site is supplanted by dark caverns, cellars, and forests as pagan sites of
worship. The sacramental mediating force is the music of Black Metal itself, as
 the microphone and guitar are the supplement of the holy altar. For bands like
Gorgoroth, the bible is replaced with Nietzsche&#8217;s<i> Zarathustra</i> and <i>The
Anti-Christ</i>, as well as with Wagner and Viking folklore. Against the
subjectivized body under God, Black Metal engages both the position of the dead
body outside of the Symbolic Order as well as that of the Viking Oskorei,
revenants who return from the abyss to judge the privileged, the decadent, and the
pious. Clandestine and occult symbols, reserved to the dark corners of society,
are all radically recuperated and elevated through Black Metal performance,
&#8216;staining&#8217; them with the &#8216;aura&#8217; of the Real&#8217;s antagonism. It is herein that the
images of Black Metal have captured the public attention by becoming
more-than-images through an effect of the Real. Further, it is in this manner
that Black Metal poses perhaps its most frightening possibility.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">While the nihilist&#8217;s position is easily absorbed in
postmodern logic, which in a way depends on a nihilistic subject, Norwegian
Black Metal is punctuated by the deployment of a particular ideological stance.
Against this hypothesis, some critics such as Breen suggest that Metal
&#8220;celebrates numbness and oblivion &#8211; a joyride into the spirit of
post-industrial alienation&#8221; (quoted in Walser, 1993, p. 23).  While there  is an
undeniable correlation of numbness and oblivion with  pleasure in Black Metal
music, is not the so-called &#8220;joyride&#8221; of Heavy Metal premised on surmounting
alienation rather than accepting it? By reliving the cut of the Symbolic, the
machine which &#8216;eats kids alive,&#8217; trauma is temporarily mastered. A second point
comes from a contradiction in Breen&#8217;s own question: How can one be in an
oblivion and still be alienated? The numbness of the full body is a way to
overcome alienation through dispersion. While this is arguably achieved through
the Imaginary articulation of the ecstatic moment performed in Black Metal, I
wonder if Black Metal itself elicits a form of bodily dispersion through the
epic, elemental, and raw force of its music?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">In an inversion of the often marginal position Heavy
Metal bands claim to occupy, Norwegian bands like Gorgoroth claim to identify
with both Viking history and the Norwegian landscape itself. A survey of
Gorgoroth&#8217;s limited press and article imagery for example reveals the band
members as &#8216;native&#8217; to the Norwegian landscape -- primal, rugged, languid.
While many Metal bands seek to stand out as ironic and shocking, confirming
their alienation from the Symbolic Order, Gorgoroth fade into the Norwegian
landscape in an Imaginary mirror phase identification born upon their bodies.
&#8220;The&#8230;logic of the grotesque image ignores the closed, smooth, and impenetrable
surface of the body&#8221; Bakhtin (1981) writes, retaining &#8220;only&#8230;that which leads
beyond the body&#8217;s limited space or into the body&#8217;s depths&#8221; (p. 4). These stark
images are often developed in black and white to preserve mirror identification
and exaggerate contrasts between surfaces and depths, extreme lightness and
blackness. In such contrast, &#8216;regular&#8217; members of the public appear in
Gorgoroth&#8217;s press photos as if somewhat reticent intruders. The connotation is
not simply one of Gorgoroth&#8217;s alienation. It also suggests belonging -- to a
place and time, to a folklore and symbology that  is particular to Norway.
While  Norwegian record labels throughout the 1990s marketed music according to
U.S. popular standards, looking to sign the Norwegian equivalent of Nirvana or
Metallica, Black Metal drew the interests of an audience occupied with more local
and socially charged anxieties (Soderlind, cited in Dunn, McFayden &amp; Wise,
2006). In a more general sense, the Black Metal movement throughout Eastern
Europe has been marked by a return to folk music instrumentation and
arrangement. Bands such as <i>Skyforger</i> in Latvia and the Czechoslovakian <i>Tollech
</i>compose music based on traditional patterns and phrasing and, in this
sense, are maintaining traditions rather than simply destroying them. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">Contra the notion that Metalheads are nihilists,
Walser (1993) forwards an ethnography of Heavy Metal culture which aguing  that
Heavy Metal is a way  of making meaning of the &#8220;fundamental contradictions of
its historical moment&#8221;  (p. 162). For Norwegian Black Metal, the
site/sight/cite of this contradiction lies in the very question Badiou (2001)
sets out: &#8216;What is Good?&#8217; Black Metal bands such as Gorgoroth have engaged in
an ongoing and active renunciation of the Good, or rather, of a Good that  has
not upheld its promise. As Walser (1993) notes, &#8220;Many young people are
frustrated at the hypocrisy they perceive around them, at the lack of history
and genuine politics in their educations and in their lives&#8221; (p. 150). This is
why the Oskorei return, to enact a brutal justice upon their Masters, and exact
a horrible retribution for the transgressions and overregulations of the
prohibitive Father. Or is it rather  the failure of the prohibitive father to
act, as the criticism of Baby Boomer passivity suggests, that has led to the
return of the punishing Oskorei? That the promises of modernity have failed,  and
yet the institutions that  support them continue to lumber on, has engendered the

institutions has always been tenuous, particularly so since the Restoration and
its corollary naturalization of liberal and democratic ideals. Yet, as Badiou
(2002) lucidly points out, we live in a time of fundamental contradiction. As
noted earlier, the current state of parliamentarian and democratic institutions
is asynchronous with the ideal of Goodness it once circulated under. As these
social apparatuses can no longer be seen as &#8216;wonderful,&#8217; Badiou suggests that
they might otherwise be seen as the &#8216;least bad of the bad,&#8217; against which
everything else is deemed horrible (Badiou, 2001/2002). For Badiou, this is why
the &#8220;idea of Evil has become essential&#8221; (Badiou, 2002). Though political,
economic, and religious institutions have become duplicitous and corrupt, the
notion that they still constitute the &#8220;the best possible state of affairs, even
if this best is not so great&#8221; is commonly accepted (Badiou, 2001/2002). Against
the state administered Evangelical Lutheran Church of Norway, it is perhaps not
surprising, then, to find the Black Metal movement associated with Satanic
Evil. While only a small number of the population practice  under the official
religion of Lutheranism, signaling a crisis of faith and Symbolic resistance,
it is still, in Badiou's formula, better than worshipping Satan!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%"><u><span style="line-height:200%">The
Malaise of Faith in the Symbolic Order</span></u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">As commentators such as Walser (1993) point out, such
a point of detail is particularly uncertain to &#8220;the first American generation
that will be worse off economically than its parents&#8221; (p. 161). Citing factors
such as &#8220;deindustrialization, a decline in union jobs, and the rise of low paid
service jobs,&#8221; Walser notes that throughout the 1980s, 97% of jobs given to
white males paid less than $7,000 a year (ibid.). Norwegian Black Metal has by
no mean remained confined to the Scandinavian borders. Black metal sub-cultures
have begun to emerge in South America,  China, and Africa. In each instance of
its emergence, the internationalization of Black Metal has continued to be
responsive to local religious and political oppression while maintaining a
disposition toward rebellion and individual agency. Arguably, this is also  true
in North America. Metanarratives of progress, freedom, and the <i>promise</i>

of a better world are further perturbed by decreased social opportunities, the
pressures of consumerism, the rising cost of goods, and diminished, alienating
returns of labor. It is in this latter vein that, in 2003, 9.9% or over three
and a half million 16-24 year olds in the United States were not officially
enrolled in high school, nor held a G.E.D or diploma equivalent (</span><span style="line-height:200%">National Center For Educational Statistics, 2003</span><span style="line-height:200%">). This statistic accounts for roughly 10.9% of the
34.6 million people in that age group, translating into &#8220;several million young
people who are out of school but lacking high school credential&#8221; (</span><span style="line-height:200%">National Center For Educational Statistics, 2000</span><span style="line-height:200%">).  While a number of significant factors influence
drop out rates, my interest here  is the population of students that leave high
school, despite doing well, as a result of a radical loss of faith in the
Symbolic Order. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">Akin to Badiou&#8217;s formula, for many students, the
&#8216;Good&#8217; has lost its &#8216;aura&#8217; or &#8216;shine,&#8217;  no longer holding desire or a trace of
the Real. This accounts for a general attitude of cynicism which,  despite
knowing of the transgressions and duplicity of the Other, acts as if it did
not. Yet, with the anti-nihilist stance of many Norwegian Black Metal
supporters, perhaps we are beginning to see the breakdown of such cynical
complacence. Exposed for its seedy history of greed, deceit, and violence, &#8216;The
Good&#8217; of modernity has become an impossible promise if but for a privileged
few. It is in this vein that Black Metal acts as a means of addressing &#8220;the
insecurities of this tumultuous era&#8230;[producing] meaning in an irrational
society [and exploring] explanations for seemingly incomprehensible phenomena&#8221;
(Walser, 1993, p. 161). This is important context for Black Metal&#8217;s &#8220;ideology
of evil&#8221; or negative ethical force.  But can such an ideology, as such Black
Metal bands as Gorgoroth have suggested, &#8216;free&#8217; the subject?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%"><u><span style="line-height:200%">Black
Metal and Ideological Evil</span></u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%"> In <i>The Metastases of Enjoyment</i>, Zizek (1994a)
develops the question of &#8217;evil&#8217; coextensive with  Freud&#8217;s superegoic- egoic and
id impulses. This strategy supports the consideration of a negative ethics
intimately linked to liberatory politics; an ethics, Leubb (2003) avers, &#8220;is
desperately [needed] under the current rein of global capital&#8221; (p. 1).  Using
Freud&#8217;s secondary topography,  Zizek describes <i>ego evil</i> as the
transgression of a universal ethics for personal pleasure. This form of evil
describes the acts of those Black Metal bands who have committed various
sacrilegious acts for notoriety, to garner media attention, and thus
potentially attract new fans and believers. If the Norwegian Church burnings
were indeed informed by an ego evil, they were successful to the end that what
was previously an &#8216;underground&#8217; scene became notorious, capturing the public
attention. In contrast to the self-serving character of ego evil, Zizek
distinguishes <i>id evil</i> as the direct link between the transgression of
the Symbolic Law and jouissance. She or he does it simply because she or he <i>likes</i>
to. The particular form of id evil is inexplicable and traumatic. It defies
Symbolic mediation in its sheer violent excesses and is not confrontable on
rational terms. Id evil most closely resonates with  the contemporary notion of
&#8216;pure evil,&#8217;  a characterization that has been used to describe such Black
Metal bands as Gorgoroth. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">The case as I have developed thus far points to the
inability of  either ego or id evil to fully explain the activities of
Norwegian Black Metal subculture. There are of course exceptions to this, with
proponents of Black Metal both perpetrating crimes for their own
self-gratification and   inexplicable psychotic acts of ecstatic violence. I
suggest, however, that in consideration of Black Metal&#8217;s highly contextualized
genealogy, their music and their references, the form of negative ethics
practiced by Norwegian Black Metal proponents is distinctly <i>superegoic</i>

in orientation. As Zizek suggests, superegoic evil is marked by the
transgression of &#8220;universal&#8221; ethics on principle. Such principles emerge as an
ideological historical or religious proclivity, and as an expression of the Big
Other&#8217;s compulsion, as when transgression is demanded by a figure of worship. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">As an affront to Christian symbology and belief, the
pagan referents of Black Metal create a direct ideological tension with the
State Church,  consumer apparatus, and the often sheepish, trend-following
consumer. The ideal subject of Black Metal lacks nothing but does not cease to
will; it is a direct response to the docility demanded by such civilizing
apparatuses as the school, the church and state. In this sense, it  acts as an
antagonistic force aimed at the Symbolic apparatus as the cite/sight/site of a
weakened subject. That is, the vision of subjectivity opposed by Black Metal is
docile, abeyant, and decadent. Bands such as Gorgoroth have deployed an
interpretation of Nietzsche&#8217;s <i>Superman</i> as the kind of subject Black
Metal seeks to inspire. This explicit ideology has resulted in Black Metal
advocates being dubbed &#8216;fanatics&#8217; and &#8216;zealots.&#8217;  Such signifiers, Zizek notes,
are often attributed to the acts and ideologies of superegoic evil, and have
similarly been deployed to describe the very religious and social structures
Black Metal ostensibly challenges. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">Another way in which superegoic evil is significantly
featured in Black Metal is through the ideological imperative of the Other.
Satan plays a significant role as an emancipator in Black Metal, a restless and
rebellious spirit who &#8216;hates&#8217; humanity. The ideology of Norwegian Black Metal
is decidedly restless, interpreting Satan&#8217;s hatred of humanity as a hatred of
how humanity has become subjectivized in ways that sever memory, history,
legends, and ties to the landscape. It is a Symbolic severing that foregrounds
this particular aspect of superegoic evil and in turn, it is through superegoic
evil that such severance is reconciled. Whereas the Evangelical Lutheran God is
an apt  metonym for the Father of Prohibition, Satan might be seen oppositely
as the Father of Permission, of freedom, and pleasure. In anthropologist Sam
Dunn&#8217;s documentary, <i>Metal: A Headbanger&#8217;s Journey</i>, he interviews
Gorgoroth &#8216;singer&#8217; Gaahl. In response to Dunn&#8217;s question &#8220;What do the church
burnings mean to you?&#8221; Gaahl ponders, responding with a single word: &#8220;Satan.&#8221;  When
pressed further as to the connotations of Satan to the Black Metal subculture,
Gaahl pauses momentarily before uttering &#8220;Freedom,&#8221; then drinking from a glass
half full of conspicuously red liquid (Dunn, McFayden &amp; Rose, 2006). </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">In another interview, Gorgoroth founder and guitarist
Infurnus comments that the band&#8217;s music &#8220;is a </span>homage to Satan through
metal music&#8221; and further, that the band members  are &#8220;Satan's humble servants
on a quest for another human species&#8230; representant of the powers of Darkness in
metal music&#8221; (Uncredited, 2005).  If this is more than a simple fa&#231;ade, then it
might be understood as indicative of a particular logic at work in superegoic
instances of evil,  that is, its reliance upon the maintenance of a Big Other.
This Big Other supplies for Black Metal bands both a source of anti-Christian
imagery and an ideological position from which to approach music making and
performativity. For Gorgoroth&#8217;s lead singer, Gaahl, such associations are not
simply limited to the stage, and in January of 2004 he was sentenced to a 14
month prison sentence for assaulting a man and reputedly threatening to drink
his blood. In Black Metal,  against the prohibitive edicts of the Evangelicals,
Satan becomes a paternal figure of permissiveness, , a figure associated with
freedom, irrepressibility, and the Imaginary distillation of evil that  Gorgoroth&#8217;s
music attempts to capture.  As Infurnus suggests in a recent interview;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.7in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Black Metal is not another musical
genre, and it is not a hobby or something you do for the fun of it. It is a
life code and it implies a certain mentality and a outlook on life. Its
meaningless to have a too strictly defined role as an artist opposed to the one
of private life, as these do blend together and one way or another have
relevance for the product being worked upon. Needless to say, as a Black Metal musician
you have to be a Satanist. With the Satanic approach to life comes a set of
goals, standards, and ethics which will always be there transcending and
affecting whatever you relate to. That I choose metal to be the genre to work
within simply can be explained as a matter of taste.  (Uncredited, 2006)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.7in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&#160;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">The case of Gorgoroth&#8217;s lead singer Gaahl seems closer
to the idea of id evil developed by Zizek,  that is, transgression as a
corollary of <i>jouissance</i>. Yet, it is critical to note that as a Big
Other, Satan does more than simply invite transgression. For the believer,
transgression and revolution would be carried out as if an edict, as ethics
with &#8216;goals&#8217; and &#8216;standards&#8217; (Uncredited, 2006). In this scenario, the
Evangelical&#8217;s repressive God is inverted as a Satanic figure of permission.
Yet, what remains untouched in this reversal is the vaunted position of the Big
Other itself. It is in this manner that such Black Metal performers as
Gorgoroth remain ideologically oriented through their relationship with Satan
as a Big Other. This Big Other in turn provides the subject of Black Metal with
identificatory coordinates confirming their position as infernal vassals. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">Zizek notes that the subject,  in playing out such
transgressions against universal ethical principles , , takes pleasure through
knowing that an ideological cause has been served via the sacrifice of its  own
ethical status. Though some Black Metal bands do not condone church burning,
they believe that it is an effective strategy against the privileged historical
and religious history of Norway espoused by the Church. The burning of churches
at the hands of pagans is  a mirror of similar conflicts at the point of
Norway&#8217;s conversion, when pagan churches were razed by Christians. The ideology
of supegoic evil supported by Black Metal seems founded on a profound sense of
judgment led by the marginalized. Satan is thus a critical figure to the
phantasmagoric assailment of the Christian ethos as one who rises up against
God, and is forever banished because of it.  </span></p>

<address style="line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">            The
ideological bearing of Black Metal is oriented toward the evocation of the
darkest imaginary phantasmagoria possible as a means to grasp the completeness
of the antagonism of which it is a symptom. As Infurnus comments elsewhere, </span></address>

<address>            &#8220;I created Gorgoroth as a tool of manipulation, to bring
up - it being live or in</address>

<address>             studio&#8230;the most sinister energies working on the psyche
of myself and others.</address>

<address>            When in the spheres of psychodrama and magic[,] common
sense and reason</address>

<address>            [are] not present&#8221;. Through Satan and Satanic practices,
Infurnus suggests that</address>

<address>            we might possess a kernel of the Real recuperated through
the paradoxes of</address>

<address>            magic and psychodramatic enactment of past trauma. Obvious
here is the image</address>

<address>            of Satan not as the suave and mustachioed seducer, but
rather as a metaphorical</address>

<address>           force, along &#8220;with other transgressive icons, the Devil is
used to signify and</address>

<address>           evoke in particular social contexts.&#8221;  (Walser, 1993, p.
152) </address>

<address>&#160;</address>

<address style="line-height:200%"><span style="line-height:200%">Ostensibly,
Gorgoroth and other Black Metal bands return to the Symbolic cut, and the
moment of madness, mysticism, and the unknown that precedes both &#8216;the leap of
faith&#8217; and reasoned subjectivity itself. In recuperating this moment of raw,
&#8216;primitive,&#8217; and elemental force, a &#8216;full body&#8217; prior to Symbolic castration
might be Imagined. In turn, the body of  the Black Metal listener, described by
some fans as &#8216;obliterated&#8217; or &#8220;slaughtered,&#8221; provides a psychic defense against
the violence of the Symbolic apparatus. </span></address>
