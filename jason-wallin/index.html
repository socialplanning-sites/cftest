Since its &#8216;Second Wave&#8217; of stylistic development (starting in 1990), this</span><span class="c1">&#160;</span><span>subgenre has garnered attention in the media for its ostensible negative impact upon contemporary youth. Beginning in the early 1990&#8217;s, proponents of the </span><span class="c1">Black Metal</span><span>&#160;movement have been associated with acts of church burning, satanic worship, murder, and ritual suicide. Such actions have circulated under the signifier of &#8216;evil,&#8217; and have in numerous cases been associated with anti-Christian symbology and pagan practices. Contemporary media and moralizing political pundits have quickly positioned such acts of &#8216;evil&#8217; beyond rational comprehension via the deployment of &#160;&#8216;a rhetoric of evil.&#8217; This enframement has evaded the psychoanalytic &#8216;question of evil&#8217; and the significant role of negative ethics in theorizing the allure and potential impact of </span><span class="c1">Black Metal </span><span>music. Drawing upon Zizek&#8217;s development of &#8216;evil&#8217; through Lacan&#8217;s three registers, this essay attempts to tease out alternate readings of &#8216;evil&#8217; through a detailed analysis of &#160;</span><span class="c1">Black Metal </span><span>music and practice, &#160;rehabilitating the complex corridors of &#8216;evil&#8217; against its conceptual collapse as merely the ontological &#8216;absence of good.&#8217; Further, via Zizek, I offer &#160;a reconsideration of the seemingly anti-establishment terrorist activities enacted by some proponents of </span><span class="c1">Black Metal </span><span>ideology. Herein, I will attempt to deploy a reading of &#8216;ideological evil&#8217; in order to interrogate the role of enjoyment and desire at work in the </span><span class="c1">Black Metal </span><span>musical subgenre. </span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span class="c4">The Psychoanalytic Question of Evil and the Influence of &#160;Black Metal Music on Youth.</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Throughout the late 1990s, a series of church burnings, murders, and suicides focused world attention on Norway and, in particular, on the now infamous &#8216;Black Metal&#8217; musical sub-culture that emerged across Scandinavia and has since proliferated worldwide. Extending from such musical referents as Venom, Celtic Frost, and Bathory in the 1980&#8217;s, the reinvigorated Norwegian Black Metal of the 1990s bears critical differences. While previous Black Metal groups were ostensible extensions of the horror entertainment industry, the &#8216;second wave&#8217; of Black Metal was marked by a transgressivity and excess collapsing the supposed differentiation of fantasy and reality. To the vehement concern of Western authorities, the Black Metal &#8216;act&#8217; was no longer being limited to the stage. Of greater anxiety was the seeming disappearance of the dividing line between the &#8216;act&#8217; and &#8216;reality,&#8217; &#8220;fa&#231;ade&#8221; and &#8220;authenticity.This anxiety coalesced throughout the period from 1992 to 1996, when over fifty Norwegian church arsons were attempted. When Norwegian Skjold, Asane, and Fantoft stave church were razed, Black Metal figure Varg Vikernes</span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" name="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span>, better known within the Black Metal milieu as Count Grishnackh, was directly implicated. Fear of repeat arsons was &#160;elevated when an image of the ruined church appeared on &#160;the cover of &#160;Vikernes&#8217; band Burzum&#8217;s album </span><span class="c1">Aske</span><span>&#160;(</span><span class="c1">Ashes</span><span>). While both the media and authorities hystericized the arson as an act of irrationality, mental illness, and spiritual evil, a latent fear lingered that such acts were ideologically motivated . Another paradoxical specter also remained. In a country ranked number one on the United Nations&#8217; human development index, the emergence of Norwegian Black Metal and its significant youth following posed a perplexing issue that would be neither remedied nor ignored. </span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span class="c4">On the Plains of Gorgoroth</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>Media attention significantly reinvigorated public fears in 2004 when Black Metal group Gorgoroth gained media infamy in Poland for the extreme sacrilegious and horrific scene of a live show in the capital city of Krakow. Extending the phantasmagoria of stark pagan and Satanic imagery to the point of their collapse with the Lacanian Real -- that is, the traumatic and excessive character of the unconscious -- &#160; &#160; They depicted blood-drenched figures attached to crucifixes, adjacent to a row of impaled animal heads, set against an apocalyptic backdrop reminiscent of Tolkien&#8217;s Mordor. The show transgressed the borderlines of the stage, leading one of the camera operators to note in an interview for the Polish media outlet &#8216;Fakty&#8217;: &#8220;We weren&#8217;t just repulsed, we were horrified. A number of major Polish publishers devoted the cover of their newspapers to this grotesque scene, capturing Gorgoroth&#8217;stransgressive overflowing, merging, and destabilization of orthodox boundaries (cf. Connelly, 2003 the scene played at what Badiou (2001) has dubbed &#8220;the passion for the Real,&#8221; that is, a 20</span><span class="c3">th</span><span>&#160;century symptom seeking &#160;experience unmediated by the Symbolic register of language and law, &#8220;the Real in its extreme violence as the price to be paid for peeling off the deceiving layers of reality&#8221; (Zizek, 2002, pp. 5-6). The sadistic image of Gorgoroth&#8217;s live show seemed to confirm the antagonism of repressed life, particularly so in its Polish Catholic context, wherein the iconography of Black Metal staged a direct affront to popular belief and identity, directly inverting the symbols of &#8216;goodness&#8217; and &#8216;godliness&#8217; into their most profane de-formations. &#160; </span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>While Gorgoroth&#8217;s performance marks an eruption of the repressed, excessive, and traumatic life of the Real, such phantasmagoria still remain intimately bound to the Lacanian Imaginary, to fantasy and the semiotic. As Zizek (2002a) avers, because the pure Real cannot be extracted from a reality that already evades being &#8216;pinned down,&#8217; the opposite effect transpires as an &#8220;obsession with pure appearance&#8221; (Zizek, 2002b). Because there is no Symbolic position from which we might articulate the kernel of the Real, or rather, because the Real resists symbolization in the differential system of language, the Imaginary fills in for this lack in representation. The Poland Newspaper Metro closed in on this scene and expressively activated its image as &#8220;Satan on Stage.&#8221; The context here is germane. The scenes of Gorgoroth&#8217;s live show in the Royal Capital City &#160;of Poland shocked an overwhelmingly Roman Catholic audience into upset and fear. Staging the ruin of &#160;Roman Catholic symbology and, as with many heavy metal bands, performing the apocalyptic moment as an escalation of violence and transgression, Gorgoroth&#8217;s performance was dubbed terroristic and &#8216;fundamentally&#8217; evil. While the crew filming the performance had previously worked with such extreme heavy metal acts as Cannibal Corpse, Children of Bodom, and Anathema, they commented that they had never seen anything as wild or raw as the Gorgoroth performance. As one commentator noted,</span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span>&#8220;In these times of big money contracts, pre-fabricated boy bands and girl groups hand </span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span>&#160;picked by a panel of TV judges, it&#8217;s so easy to forget that </span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span>&#160;there are bands out there that are the real deal &#8211; and Gorgoroth are definitely that. In</span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span>&#160;fact, with Gorgoroth you have to wonder whether they are a little too real.&#8221; </span></p><p class="c14 c7 c0"><span>(Uncredited, 2006) </span></p><p class="c7 c8 c0 c14"><span></span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>Polish authorities were quick to confiscate the footage of the scene pending a full scale investigation aimed at determining if Gorgoroth had broken a Polish law restricting religious offence. Despite the dismissal of all charges, the anxiety engendered by the Black Metal movement had returned in full force, marking for many the return of Satanic evil incarnate. </span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>However, this connection to Satanism was not new. Reporting on the church burningsof the 1990s, media outlets across Norway hystericized the connection to Satanism. Tr&#248;rstein Grude&#8217;s 1998 documentary, </span><span class="c1">Satan Rir Media </span><span>(Satan Rides the Media) demonstrates how the Norwegian and later world media quickly elevated the Black Metal scene to the level of international recognition through the evocation of Satanism. While Norwegian police expressed concern at dubbing the Black Metal scene Satanic for lack of evidence, the term emerged daily in Norwegian newspapers, on television and the radio (Grude, 1998). While largely unsubstantiated, the interconnection of Black Metal to pure Satanic &#160;evil was profitable news- making. &#160;</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>To name a thing evil, Badiou (2001/2002) claims, we must already be subjectivized, &#160;that is, we must already be located in the symbolic order in a way through which a particular thing might be construed as &#8216;Evil.&#8217; Of course, such a position is that of assuming one&#8217;s alignment with the Symbolic &#8216;Good.&#8217; &#160;Badiou extends this claim to articulate the political apparatus along the structures &#8216;Good&#8217; and &#160; &#8216;Evil.&#8217; Even though &#8220;our leaders and propagandists know very well that liberal capitalism is an inegalitarian regime, unjust, and unacceptable for the vast majority of humanity,&#8221; it is better than living in &#8220;a condition of Evil&#8221; (Badiou, 2001/2002). For many, Gorgoroth&#8217;s live show was a confirmation of this Pascalian wager: that &#160;it is better to believe in an ostensibly democratic and liberal society or religious system than to risk its </span><span class="c1">Other</span><span>. </span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span class="c4">Impossibility and Necessity: Imaginary Interventions and the Real</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>&#160;As Zupancic (2001) suggests, the Otherness of subjectivity, the repressed and unconscious, returns as a conjunction of the </span><span class="c1">impossible</span><span>&#160;and the </span><span class="c1">necessary</span><span>. In this vein, there is an intimate connection between evil and the Imaginary. &#8220;The link between &#8216;evil&#8217; (in the common use of this word) and the Imaginary springs from the fact that we are dealing with something that has no image&#8221; (ibid.). In other words, because the Other resists Symbolization, Imaginary intervention becomes a site of the </span><span class="c1">impossibility</span><span>&#160;of capturing the pure Real but, also, as a mediating </span><span class="c1">necessity</span><span>. The lack of subjectivity and its inability to directly articulate its psychic turmoil are mediated through the Imaginary as a &#8220;face to some disturbing void beyond representation&#8221; (ibid. ). As Bakhtin (1984) similarly elucidates, the inexpressible lack of the Symbolic Order is supplemented by an embodied carnivalesque body &#8220;that figures in all the expressions of the unofficial speech of the people&#8221; (p. 318). </span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>Zizek (1994b) demonstrates this function of the Imaginary in his treatment of the specter of ideology. As he &#160;contends, the antagonism in society is often interpreted as constituted by the fundamental antimony of complementary opposites. The antagonism staged in Gorgoroth&#8217;s Krakow performance, then, was perhaps unsurprisingly disposed to be treated as a conflict of &#8216;good&#8217; vs. &#8216;evil.&#8217; For Zizek, what is denied in this interpretive move toward binaries is a spectral supplement that disrupts the ostensible organic completeness of the binary pair. Apropos Schelling, Zizek points to this excess beyond the binary pair as indicative of a ternary structure at work. Not simply &#8216;good versus evil&#8217; then, but its supplemental folding in the antihero, the corrupt bastion of truth, the ethical deceiver and deceived ethicist. He &#160;points out that this ideological specter supplements what the binary pairing cannot symbolize. The spectral supplement is in this way a means of coping with the antagonism of the Real, in effect making sense of non-sense. Because this spectral supplement is unsymbolizable along the differential logic of the binary pair, it relies heavily on Imaginary interventions and the assemblages of seemingly incommensurate forms. Into the gap which evades symbolic articulation floods the calculus of the Imaginary playing as close as it can to an unrepresentable Real. Yet, as we close in to test the &#8216;reality&#8217; of these Imaginary beachheads, the &#8216;passion for the Real&#8217; can become fatal.</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span class="c4">The Anti-Christ and Black Metal</span><span>&#160;</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>&#160;Perhaps here we might understand Gorgoroth as an Imaginary representation for the unrepresentable antagonisms of religion, class, and subjectivity. The violence articulated through Black Metal music might be understood as </span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span>&#8220;popular because of its metaphorical relationship to class or social conflict&#8230;</span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span>&#160;[offering] points of relevance to people living in societies where the power</span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span>&#160;and resources are inequitably distributed and structures along lines of conflicting</span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span>&#160;interests. &#8221; (Fiske, 1989, p. 134-135) </span></p><p class="c5 c8 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>The Black Metal movement shares a counter-position to Christianity; &#160;Gorgoroth, in particular, appropriates Nietzsche&#8217;s </span><span class="c1">The Anti-Christ</span><span>&#160;(1968) as an assumption ofpower through Satan. The official Gorgorothweb site, for example, deploys a fragment of Nietzsche as if a manifesto:</span></p><p class="c13 c0"><span>&#160;I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge, for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and small enough, - I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race (p.62).</span></p><p class="c13 c8 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>This position marks a deep seated antagonism over what some Norwegians understand as the erasure of their heritage and identity by way of the interposition of Evangelical Lutheranism. Nietzsche&#8217;s critique rails at the religious subject psychically structured via the naturalization of &#8216;original sin,&#8217; &#8216;mercy,&#8217; &#8216;faith,&#8217; and &#8216;the good.&#8217; &#160;Nietzsche&#8217;s commentary on the religio-historical fabrication of the subject points also to the sublimation of the will and agency through constant deferral to &#160;God as a psychic &#160;Big Other. As Nietzsche suggests, &#8220;pagans are all those who say yes to life, and to whom &#8216;God&#8217; is a word signifying acquiescence in all things&#8221; (pp. 55-56). The connection between faith and blessedness, Nietzsche avers, is premised not on a demonstration (you cannot demonstrate blessedness) but a </span><span class="c1">promise</span><span>. </span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>This promise, &#8220;that one </span><span class="c1">shall </span><span>be blessed because one believes,&#8221; pivots on an absurd non-sense element. Nietzsche forwards the formula, &#8220;I believe that faith makes for blessedness &#8211; </span><span class="c1">therefore</span><span>&#160;it is true&#8221; as an indication of the aporetic breach in the &#8216;leap of faith.&#8217; This non-sense at the heart of truth, the &#8220;</span><span class="c1">therefore</span><span>,&#8221; can never be delivered by the priest as pure Real, and in its place Nietzsche suggests, floods a phantasmagoria of authoritative poses and &#160;postures more captivating than &#160;reasons. Nietzsche (1968) writes, </span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span>&#8220;under Christianity neither morality nor religion has any point of contact with </span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span>&#160;actuality. It offers purely imaginary </span><span class="c1">causes </span><span>(&#8216;God&#8217; &#8216;soul,&#8217; &#8216;ego,&#8217; &#8216;spirit,&#8217;</span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span>&#160;&#8216;free will&#8217;--or even &#8216;unfree&#8217;), and purely imaginary</span><span class="c1">&#160;effects </span><span>(&#8216;sin,&#8217; </span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span>&#8216;salvation,&#8217; &#8216;grace,&#8217; &#8216;punishment,&#8217; &#8216;forgiveness of sins&#8217;&#8221; (p. 9). </span></p><p class="c7 c8 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>In this sense, the semiotics deployed by the priest in this sense act to mediate what cannot be fully presented, the pure Real of the </span><span class="c1">beyond</span><span>&#160;as a proof of blessedness and pleasure. Of course, there is no empirical basis by which blessedness or goodness could be founded (Zupancic, 2001). For many Black Metal bands, the reliance on an excessive and carnivalesque semiology acts as a similar attempt to Imagine the Real. This phantasmagoria is of course played out with an essential difference in its Christian and Pagan renditions, one that has perhaps been incorrectly, albeit strategically disclosed following the binary opposition of good and evil. &#160;</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>It is significant to note at this juncture that many proponents of Norwegian Black Metal consider themselves Odalists rather than Satanists, suggesting not only a spiritual, but national crisis at work within the sub-culture. A principal way in which &#160;Odalism is distinct from Satanismis its &#160;Social Nationalist connotations. . From the proto-Germanic </span><span class="c1">opalan</span><span>&#160;-- &#160;more roughly, &#8216;heritage,&#8217; &#8216;homeland,&#8217; &#8216;fatherland&#8217; -- Odalism marks the exertion of national pride by privileging a return to original geographical lineages, ethnic knowledge and practices. It should be noted that many practitioners of Odalism follow pagan beliefs on environmental protection, reviving narrative tradition, and animism, though many of these movements do not condone antagonism toward the Christian church. For many of its followers, Odalism marks the Imaginary restoration of Teutonic genealogies in turn recuperating a nationalist authenticity. While many Black Metal bands have directly divorced themselves from or obscured their political affiliations, or practice a politic while ignorant, other bands such as Burzum, Mayhem, and Gorgoroth have supported the burning of Lutheran churches across Norway as a means of reviving Nordic tradition and reinvigorating a nationalist </span><span class="c1">Ubermensch</span><span>. In this vein, the relationship between Christianity and Nordic paganism cannot be overlooked. </span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span class="c4">A Brief History of the Christian Conversion of Norway</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>Rule by Olaf I Tryggvason in 995 A.D saw the coastline of Norway and its western islands inculcated under the sign of Christianity. Pagan churches were razed while commissioned missionaries proliferated and subjects were offered a choice between baptism and death. Norway was officially converted then under Olaf I&#8217;s zealous rule. Yet, by this same time, Christian symbology, ritual, and writing had already formed a strong cultural subtext. Attempted conversion of Scandinavia can be traced as early as 725 A.D., when an Anglo Saxon mission led by St. Willibrord was received diplomatically, but failed to effect significant cultural &#160;change. By 820 A.D., Frankish missionaries led an ongoing agenda of conversion with the support of Emperor Louis the Pious. During this period, worshippers of Odin and Christians alike cohabited in the Viking city of Hadeby, during which such pagan symbols as runes and Thor&#8217;s hammer circulated along with &#160;the Christian cross as common adornments. The presence of pagan and Christian graves are also archaeologically evidenced prior to 995 A.D., as is &#160;a currency circulated in Viking York integrating pagan symbols such as Thor&#8217;s hammer with the name of St. Peter. So where is the location of the &#8216;authentic&#8217; cultural moment that the Odalists seek to recuperate? That is, if Viking and Christian communities, rites, and symbols have co-existed economically and politically for hundreds of years, what constitutes the Teutonic Folkish moment of authenticity? For Black Metal proponents, Teutonic origins connote the period prior to Christian conversion. &#160;</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span class="c4">The Significance of the Apocalyptic Moment</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>Intimate to the recuperation of &#8216;cultural authenticity&#8217; is the scene of the apocalyptic moment staged by such Black Metal Bands as Gorgoroth. As Baudrillard (2003) comments re &#160;our current cultural condition, neoliberalism has induced a certain &#8216;limitlessness&#8217; of development and production in which &#8220;the end can no longer be located&#8221; (p. 55). As Baudrillard notes apropos Fukuyama, the fear is not that history will have an end, but rather, that it will have no end, &#8220;and hence no longer any finality, any purpose&#8221; (p. 57). &#8216;The End,&#8217; as Baudrillard suggests, marks such a point of finality of both purpose and meaning. It is toward such an illusory end that the apocalyptic moment of Black Metal is oriented, and through this, the retroactive restoration of origins through which &#8220;the play of cause and effect will be possible&#8221; (p. 57). Rather than extraditing the moment of Symbolic death -- as we see in social attempts to escape age, control birth, and curtail the onset of alternatives -- the Black Metal movement significantly centers on the recuperation and deployment of death as a symbolization of time&#8217;s end (cf. Baudrillard, 2002). With such an end point put into play, the purpose of the Viking mythos is not only rehabilitated, it is further connected to the Symbolic death of Christian subjectivity, and in Black Metal, the birth of a new subjectivity that &#160;lacks nothing because of its proximity to an illusory original condition. In this vein, Zizek (2002a) notes &#8220;the fundamental illusion is here that, once the violent work of purification is done, the New Man will emerge </span><span class="c1">ex nihilo</span><span>, freed from the filth of the past corruption&#8221; &#160;(p. &#160;) &#160; . PLEASE add page #</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>At the height of the mid 1990s controversy over Black Metal church burnings, although roughly 85% of the population were statistically affiliated with the Church of Norway, less than 5% of the Norwegian population regularly attended church services or considered themselves active members of a church community. Public leaders have been quick to point out the waning &#160;status of religion in Norway, including its problematic administration via a governmental bureaucracy that oversees budget, the selection of &#160;bishops, and the development of mandatory religious curriculum in schools. &#8220;The Satanists are right to target the hypocrisy of Norway&#8217;s spiritual life&#8221; notes now ex-Commissioner of Children&#8217;s Rights in Norway, Trond Viggo Torgerson. "It's a very discouraging time in our country,&#8221; &#160;he &#160;adds, &#8220;Everyday life is dull and consumer orientated. Most people would rather have a McDonald's in their community than a church" ( quoted in Steinke, 1996, p. &#160;). &#160;PLEASE add page # &#160;This general attitude of complacence is a significant reason, Professor of Social Anthropology Thomas Erikson suggests, why some Norwegian youth are attracted to Black Metal as a form of symbolic resistance and individual ascendancy (cited in Dunn, McFayden &amp; Wise, 2006). Contrary to the passivity and bourgeois aspirations of the preceding generation, the Black Metal movement advocates &#160;subjective agency and &#160;a vision of individuality precluded from &#160;acting </span><span class="c1">in</span><span>&#160;and </span><span class="c1">upon </span><span>the world. Further, the general malaise of spiritual life under Christianity and consumerism has led many Black Metal bands to embrace Viking mythopoetics, which &#8220;can perhaps be more personal because [they have] not yet been appropriated by the establishment of [Western] society&#8221; &#160;(ibid.) &#160;(). Viking mythological figures, Erikson notes, are constituted by conflicted, unpredictable characterizations. They are neither good or evil, but embody both good </span><span class="c1">and</span><span>&#160;evil. In this way, the Viking mythologies &#160;&#8220;are easier to identify with&#8221;, particularly in a world that seems increasingly polarized and symbolically demarcated (ibid.). &#160; &#160;). </span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span class="c4">Black Metal, Symbolic Castration, and the &#8216;Desert of the Real&#8217;</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>The popularity of Black Metal speaks to a general malaise that is also prevalent in North America, one that has reached its extreme limits as both the mortification of the subject and &#160;a &#8216;passion for the Real&#8217; (Badiou, 2002). &#160;It is obvious that Black Metal is not apathetic. Seemingly, its lack of nihilism is one of its most frightening features in that through &#160;nihilism it might have been &#160;rendered impotent and absorbed into cynical culture. It &#160;might rather be seen/scene as a symptom of the apathetic, that is, of the subject cut off from his/her jouissance through the draining of the Big Other&#8217;s desire. &#160;For &#160;many Black Metal bands, &#8216;acquiescence&#8217; to God as a Big Other has ostensibly severed &#160;subjects from their own will and pleasure. Unable to provide a position from which the subject might address his/her own s &#160; Symbolic castration, institutional overregulation, and corollary alienation, Black Metal perpetually eulogizes the cut, languidly playing out the moment of madness intimate to the act of faith and, concomitantly, the constitution of the subject. Such psychodrama is &#160;evidenced in the form of Gorgoroth&#8217;s music and through lead singer Gaahl&#8217;s vocals, which are more reminiscent of a tortured primal scream than any attempt at languaged representation. Functioning at the limit of the Symbolic and Real registers, between language and primitive vocalization, Gaahl performs the castrating function of the Symbolic cut, the immersion into an alienating language as a scream of suffering and tortured resistance. </span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><a href="#" name="id.0eeec441fc58"></a><span>Such resistance and suffering are &#160;evidenced by those Black Metal bands who employ &#8216;corpsepaint.&#8217; As a representation of their status as dead or outsiders to the Symbolic order, &#8216;corpsepaint&#8217; faces are a connotation of the resistance performed by Black Metal performers and followers. In an age of surface aesthetics, extreme make-overs, and a general preoccupation with youthful appearance, the &#8216;corpsepaint&#8217; face is a cracked, moribund, and sometimes bloodied illustration of faciality in its decayed, most exposed figuration. Yet beyond the mere theatricality of such facial decoration, &#8216;corpsepaint&#8217; is connected to Viking folklore and, more specifically, to the fallen spirits of the battlefield, Odin&#8217;s &#8216;Oskorei.&#8217; It is significant, then, that &#8216;corpsepaint&#8217; is a reflection of having not only died in the Symbolic realm, but of the war that </span><span class="c1">is </span><span>the Symbolic realm, the site where so many of today&#8217;s youth wage an ongoing and often dire struggle for recognition, individuality, and particularity. In this way, Black Metal audiences might find psychic comfort in the Imaginary bodies of Gorgoroth. </span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>Clad in protruding spikes, ammunition belts, and frequently photographed wielding medieval weapons, Black Metal bands such as Gorgoroth portray the body as a war-machine -- &#160;untouchable, caustic, and yet protected. This Imaginary body not only confers a sense of psychic and physical power, prowess, and virility, it is also a body that wards against &#8216;being eaten alive&#8217; by a Chronos like Symbolic apparatus. This anxiety over being consumed, of being eaten alive, is very much a gendered castration anxiety. In this vein, the hardening and sheathing of the male body in metal concomitantly creates &#8220;a defense against culturally produced gender anxieties&#8221; (Walser, 1993, p. 116). The masculine body displayed by such bands as Gorgoroth thus forms an Imaginary screen for the controlled and mastered body prior to Symbolic castration. Yet, somewhat paradoxically, this fantasy screen concomitantly acts as a display of wildness and untamed virulence not yet domesticated by the law and societal moral regulations. In this vein, it is significant to note that the Viking Oskorei are not simply reserved to a position of death or passivity in waiting to be consumed. In Norse mythology, the Oskorei are spirits of vengeance that return to judge the judges and hunt the righteous. They are the repressed energies and bodies that both haunt and demand indemnification, disinclined to fade away like &#8216;good&#8217; ghosts are wont or made to do. &#160;</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>&#160;Black Metal bands approach recording and production from a raw and grainy perspective, imbuing the music with elemental, folk, and dark overtones. This melancholic approach typical of Black Metal perhaps marks the inability to fully mourn the lost object of the Real, the full intensities of the body and the libidinal, elemental energy of a &#8216;raw life.&#8217; &#160;It draws from both epic orchestral forms, elevating the music to flights of transcendence, and &#160;languid atmospheric desolation, a musical variation &#160;on what Zizek (2002b) has dubbed &#8216;the desert of the Real,&#8217; a representation of life stripped of its placating or obfuscating Symbolic veils. In this sense, Black Metal demonstrates &#160;Badiou&#8217;s &#160;&#8216;passion for the Real&#8217; in constantly attempting to evoke an &#8216;essential&#8217; form of evil. Even the name Gorgoroth refers to Tolkien&#8217;s desolate wasteland north of Mordor, constituting yet another analogy to &#160;the &#8216;desert of the Real,&#8217; the void at the heart of the Symbolic Order. </span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span class="c4">The Stain of the Real and the Transparency of the Image</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>Zupancic (2001) poses the question of whether there is an image of evil that can &#8216;fill in&#8217; the inability of the image to represent the Real. In response, she hypothesizes an aspect of the Imaginary that &#160;is not an image but, instead, a way in which an image stands out as &#8220;an effect of the Real on our imagination, the last veil or screen that separates us from the impossible.&#8221; &#160;This i &#160; Image, she &#160;suggests, &#160;holds &#160;a &#8220;special power of fascination&#8221; or element of complexity afforded in part by its inability to &#160;fully Symbolize the Real. In other words, the &#8216;glow&#8217; of the Image is intimately connected to a lack in the Symbolic Order, an inability to &#160;provide a position to the marginalized and, further, to account for the emergence of alternative positions or repressed energies. Perhaps this too is an aspect of the &#8216;passion for the Real,&#8217; wherein the Imaginary register becomes captured in an impetus to reveal &#160;all things secret, clandestine, and occult, that is, to bring all &#8216;hidden&#8217; acts into purview, thus affording them what &#160;Zupancic &#160; calls &#160; &#8220;aur,&#8221; , &#8220;glow,&#8221; &#160;and &#8220;shine.&#8221; &#160; &#160;</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>Baudrillard, in his &#160;</span><span class="c1">Passwords </span><span>(2003), &#160;asks, given the 20</span><span class="c3">th</span><span>&#160;century passion for the Real, &#8220;what happens to the things once kept secret?&#8221; (p. 33). Obverse to visible exchange, Baudrillard notes that &#8216;secrets&#8217; function to remove something from the visible order. Yet, in a world that &#8220;tends toward the visible&#8221; what happens to such acts that often shared in secret as part of an &#8220;invisible exchange&#8221; (ibid. ). The clandestine acts of occult worship and ritual become, in this formulation, maleficent, and as such are targeted for extermination as acts of ostensible &#8216;evil.&#8217; &#160;Yet, as Baudrillard suggests, the secret cannot be exterminated and, as such, &#160;will instead be diabolized and drawn out &#8220;through the very instruments used to annihilate it&#8221; (ibid.) . As Debray comments on Debord&#8217;s society of the spectacle, we are no longer in a societythat &#160;creates a distance between things, alienating the subject and object but, rather, &#8220;our curse is that we have been brought up ultra-close against them&#8230;and this all-too real world is obscene&#8221; &#160; quoted in Baudrillard, 2003, p. 28). This notion of obscenity is in part the perverse inversion of secrecy and seduction, in which &#160;all exchange is realized at increasingly minimized and fractal distances. </span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>Through obscenity and &#8220;the total visibility of things,&#8221; the world is given to a transparency through which Imaginary and Real registers collapse and bleed through one another in a manner akin to a Medieval palimpsest. In this manner, it is perhaps more apt to speak not of transparency but rather, of transpiration or &#8216;showing-through&#8217;. &#160;In this 20</span><span class="c3">th</span><span>&#160;century phase, we are forced, Baudrillard suggests, to employ the &#8220;fatal strategies&#8221; of ambivalence, cynicism, and radical doubt lest &#8220;this particular transparency&#8230;be totally lethal&#8221; (p. 29). In this vein, it is perhaps not surprising to recognize how coverage of the Norwegian Black Metal movement continues to be occupied by the question of whether it is &#8216;real&#8217; or a &#8216;fa&#231;ade,&#8217; inciting disbelief and an attitude of cynicism as a psychic &#160;beachhead protecting one from the &#8220;irresolvable antagonism&#8221; of the obscene, an opposition between good and evil for which &#8220;there is no possible reconciliation&#8221; (ibid.). &#160; &#8220;Whatever laughter&#8221; such acts as Gorgoroth might elicit is &#160;&#8220;conjoined with feelings of repulsion and dread,&#8221; as an expression of the Symbolic lack and antagonism they attempt to mediate (ibid., p. 10). &#160;</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>In much of Black Metal, signs of the &#8216;Good&#8217; are directly inverted. This inversion however, is not simply between the terms of good and evil, but rather between the modes of existence expressed by the signifiers &#8216;good&#8217; and &#8216;evil.&#8217; &#160;In a literal sense, the &#8216;Goodly&#8217; figure of the priest and altar, church, &#160;sacrament, and holy text are inverted in Black Metal iconography. The pious priest, servant to God, is opposed in the image of the warrior cleric -- &#160;independent, willful, and aggressive. The church as a holy site is supplanted by dark caverns, cellars, and forests as pagan sites of worship. The sacramental mediating force is the music of Black Metal itself, as &#160;the microphone and guitar are the supplement of the holy altar. For bands like Gorgoroth, the bible is replaced with Nietzsche&#8217;s</span><span class="c1">&#160;Zarathustra</span><span>&#160;and </span><span class="c1">The Anti-Christ</span><span>, as well as with Wagner and Viking folklore. Against the subjectivized body under God, Black Metal engages both the position of the dead body outside of the Symbolic Order as well as that of the Viking Oskorei, revenants who return from the abyss to judge the privileged, the decadent, and the pious. Clandestine and occult symbols, reserved to the dark corners of society, are all radically recuperated and elevated through Black Metal performance, &#8216;staining&#8217; them with the &#8216;aura&#8217; of the Real&#8217;s antagonism. It is herein that the images of Black Metal have captured the public attention by becoming more-than-images through an effect of the Real. Further, it is in this manner that Black Metal poses perhaps its most frightening possibility.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c4">The Trace of Ideology in Black Metal</span><span>&#160;</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>While the nihilist&#8217;s position is easily absorbed in postmodern logic, which in a way depends on a nihilistic subject, Norwegian Black Metal is punctuated by the deployment of a particular ideological stance. Against this hypothesis, some critics such as Breen suggest that Metal &#8220;celebrates numbness and oblivion &#8211; a joyride into the spirit of post-industrial alienation&#8221; (quoted in Walser, 1993, p. 23). &#160;While there &#160;is an undeniable correlation of numbness and oblivion with &#160;pleasure in Black Metal music, is not the so-called &#8220;joyride&#8221; of Heavy Metal premised on surmounting alienation rather than accepting it? By reliving the cut of the Symbolic, the machine which &#8216;eats kids alive,&#8217; trauma is temporarily mastered. A second point comes from a contradiction in Breen&#8217;s own question: How can one be in an oblivion and still be alienated? The numbness of the full body is a way to overcome alienation through dispersion. While this is arguably achieved through the Imaginary articulation of the ecstatic moment performed in Black Metal, I wonder if Black Metal itself elicits a form of bodily dispersion through the epic, elemental, and raw force of its music?</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>In an inversion of the often marginal position Heavy Metal bands claim to occupy, Norwegian bands like Gorgoroth claim to identify with both Viking history and the Norwegian landscape itself. A survey of Gorgoroth&#8217;s limited press and article imagery for example reveals the band members as &#8216;native&#8217; to the Norwegian landscape -- primal, rugged, languid. While many Metal bands seek to stand out as ironic and shocking, confirming their alienation from the Symbolic Order, Gorgoroth fade into the Norwegian landscape in an Imaginary mirror phase identification born upon their bodies. &#8220;The&#8230;logic of the grotesque image ignores the closed, smooth, and impenetrable surface of the body&#8221; Bakhtin (1981) writes, retaining &#8220;only&#8230;that which leads beyond the body&#8217;s limited space or into the body&#8217;s depths&#8221; (p. 4). These stark images are often developed in black and white to preserve mirror identification and exaggerate contrasts between surfaces and depths, extreme lightness and blackness. In such contrast, &#8216;regular&#8217; members of the public appear in Gorgoroth&#8217;s press photos as if somewhat reticent intruders. The connotation is not simply one of Gorgoroth&#8217;s alienation. It also suggests belonging -- to a place and time, to a folklore and symbology that &#160;is particular to Norway. While &#160;Norwegian record labels throughout the 1990s marketed music according to U.S. popular standards, looking to sign the Norwegian equivalent of Nirvana or Metallica, Black Metal drew the interests of an audience occupied with more local and socially charged anxieties (Soderlind, cited in Dunn, McFayden &amp; Wise, 2006). In a more general sense, the Black Metal movement throughout Eastern Europe has been marked by a return to folk music instrumentation and arrangement. Bands such as </span><span class="c1">Skyforger</span><span>&#160;in Latvia and the Czechoslovakian </span><span class="c1">Tollech </span><span>compose music based on traditional patterns and phrasing and, in this sense, are maintaining traditions rather than simply destroying them. </span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>Contra the notion that Metalheads are nihilists, Walser (1993) forwards an ethnography of Heavy Metal culture which aguing &#160;that Heavy Metal is a way &#160;of making meaning of the &#8220;fundamental contradictions of its historical moment&#8221; &#160;(p. 162). For Norwegian Black Metal, the site/sight/cite of this contradiction lies in the very question Badiou (2001) sets out: &#8216;What is Good?&#8217; Black Metal bands such as Gorgoroth have engaged in an ongoing and active renunciation of the Good, or rather, of a Good that &#160;has not upheld its promise. As Walser (1993) notes, &#8220;Many young people are frustrated at the hypocrisy they perceive around them, at the lack of history and genuine politics in their educations and in their lives&#8221; (p. 150). This is why the Oskorei return, to enact a brutal justice upon their Masters, and exact a horrible retribution for the transgressions and overregulations of the prohibitive Father. Or is it rather &#160;the failure of the prohibitive father to act, as the criticism of Baby Boomer passivity suggests, that has led to the return of the punishing Oskorei? That the promises of modernity have failed, &#160;and yet the institutions that &#160;support them continue to lumber on, has engendered the &#160;generalized mistrust, skepticism, and anger prevalent in Black Metal. In Grude&#8217;s 1998 documentary, </span><span class="c1">Satan Rides the Media</span><span>, Varg Vikernes remarks to this end,</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The motive of revenge is there, the way I see it.

Yet, as Badiou (2002) lucidly points out, we live in a time of fundamental contradiction. As noted earlier, the current state of parliamentarian and democratic institutions is asynchronous with the ideal of Goodness it once circulated under. As these social apparatuses can no longer be seen as &#8216;wonderful,&#8217; Badiou suggests that they might otherwise be seen as the &#8216;least bad of the bad,&#8217; against which everything else is deemed horrible (Badiou, 2001/2002). For Badiou, this is why the &#8220;idea of Evil has become essential&#8221; (Badiou, 2002). Though political, economic, and religious institutions have become duplicitous and corrupt, the notion that they still constitute the &#8220;the best possible state of affairs, even if this best is not so great&#8221; is commonly accepted (Badiou, 2001/2002). Against the state administered Evangelical Lutheran Church of Norway, it is perhaps not surprising, then, to find the Black Metal movement associated with Satanic Evil. While only a small number of the population practice &#160;under the official religion of Lutheranism, signaling a crisis of faith and Symbolic resistance, it is still, in Badiou's formula, better than worshipping Satan!</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span class="c4">The Malaise of Faith in the Symbolic Order</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>As commentators such as Walser (1993) point out, such a point of detail is particularly uncertain to &#8220;the first American generation that will be worse off economically than its parents&#8221; (p. 161). Citing factors such as &#8220;deindustrialization, a decline in union jobs, and the rise of low paid service jobs,&#8221; Walser notes that throughout the 1980s, 97% of jobs given to white males paid less than $7,000 a year (ibid.). Norwegian Black Metal has by no mean remained confined to the Scandinavian borders. Black metal sub-cultures have begun to emerge in South America, &#160;China, and Africa. In each instance of its emergence, the internationalization of Black Metal has continued to be responsive to local religious and political oppression while maintaining a disposition toward rebellion and individual agency. Arguably, this is also &#160;true in North America. Metanarratives of progress, freedom, and the </span><span class="c1">promise</span><span>&#160;of a better world are further perturbed by decreased social opportunities, the pressures of consumerism, the rising cost of goods, and diminished, alienating returns of labor. It is in this latter vein that, in 2003, 9.9% or over three and a half million 16-24 year olds in the United States were not officially enrolled in high school, nor held a G.E.D or diploma equivalent (National Center For Educational Statistics, 2003). This statistic accounts for roughly 10.9% of the 34.6 million people in that age group, translating into &#8220;several million young people who are out of school but lacking high school credential&#8221; (National Center For Educational Statistics, 2000). &#160;While a number of significant factors influence drop out rates, my interest here &#160;is the population of students that leave high school, despite doing well, as a result of a radical loss of faith in the Symbolic Order. </span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>Akin to Badiou&#8217;s formula, for many students, the &#8216;Good&#8217; has lost its &#8216;aura&#8217; or &#8216;shine,&#8217; &#160;no longer holding desire or a trace of the Real. This accounts for a general attitude of cynicism which, &#160;despite knowing of the transgressions and duplicity of the Other, acts as if it did not. Yet, with the anti-nihilist stance of many Norwegian Black Metal supporters, perhaps we are beginning to see the breakdown of such cynical complacence. Exposed for its seedy history of greed, deceit, and violence, &#8216;The Good&#8217; of modernity has become an impossible promise if but for a privileged few. It is in this vein that Black Metal acts as a means of addressing &#8220;the insecurities of this tumultuous era&#8230;[producing] meaning in an irrational society [and exploring] explanations for seemingly incomprehensible phenomena&#8221; (Walser, 1993, p. 161). This is important context for Black Metal&#8217;s &#8220;ideology of evil&#8221; or negative ethical force. &#160;But can such an ideology, as such Black Metal bands as Gorgoroth have suggested, &#8216;free&#8217; the subject?</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c8 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5 c7 c8 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span class="c4">Black Metal and Ideological Evil</span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>&#160;In </span><span class="c1">The Metastases of Enjoyment</span><span>, Zizek (1994a) develops the question of &#8217;evil&#8217; coextensive with &#160;Freud&#8217;s superegoic- egoic and id impulses. This strategy supports the consideration of a negative ethics intimately linked to liberatory politics; an ethics, Leubb (2003) avers, &#8220;is desperately [needed] under the current rein of global capital&#8221; (p. 1). &#160;Using Freud&#8217;s secondary topography, &#160;Zizek describes </span><span class="c1">ego evil</span><span>&#160;as the transgression of a universal ethics for personal pleasure. This form of evil describes the acts of those Black Metal bands who have committed various sacrilegious acts for notoriety, to garner media attention, and thus potentially attract new fans and believers. If the Norwegian Church burnings were indeed informed by an ego evil, they were successful to the end that what was previously an &#8216;underground&#8217; scene became notorious, capturing the public attention. In contrast to the self-serving character of ego evil, Zizek distinguishes </span><span class="c1">id evil</span><span>&#160;as the direct link between the transgression of the Symbolic Law and jouissance. She or he does it simply because she or he </span><span class="c1">likes</span><span>&#160;to. The particular form of id evil is inexplicable and traumatic. It defies Symbolic mediation in its sheer violent excesses and is not confrontable on rational terms. Id evil most closely resonates with &#160;the contemporary notion of &#8216;pure evil,&#8217; &#160;a characterization that has been used to describe such Black Metal bands as Gorgoroth. </span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>The case as I have developed thus far points to the inability of &#160;either ego or id evil to fully explain the activities of Norwegian Black Metal subculture. There are of course exceptions to this, with proponents of Black Metal both perpetrating crimes for their own self-gratification and &#160; inexplicable psychotic acts of ecstatic violence. I suggest, however, that in consideration of Black Metal&#8217;s highly contextualized genealogy, their music and their references, the form of negative ethics practiced by Norwegian Black Metal proponents is distinctly </span><span class="c1">superegoic</span><span>&#160;in orientation. As Zizek suggests, superegoic evil is marked by the transgression of &#8220;universal&#8221; ethics on principle. Such principles emerge as an ideological historical or religious proclivity, and as an expression of the Big Other&#8217;s compulsion, as when transgression is demanded by a figure of worship. </span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>As an affront to Christian symbology and belief, the pagan referents of Black Metal create a direct ideological tension with the State Church, &#160;consumer apparatus, and the often sheepish, trend-following consumer. The ideal subject of Black Metal lacks nothing but does not cease to will; it is a direct response to the docility demanded by such civilizing apparatuses as the school, the church and state. In this sense, it &#160;acts as an antagonistic force aimed at the Symbolic apparatus as the cite/sight/site of a weakened subject. That is, the vision of subjectivity opposed by Black Metal is docile, abeyant, and decadent. Bands such as Gorgoroth have deployed an interpretation of Nietzsche&#8217;s </span><span class="c1">Superman</span><span>&#160;as the kind of subject Black Metal seeks to inspire. This explicit ideology has resulted in Black Metal advocates being dubbed &#8216;fanatics&#8217; and &#8216;zealots.&#8217; &#160;Such signifiers, Zizek notes, are often attributed to the acts and ideologies of superegoic evil, and have similarly been deployed to describe the very religious and social structures Black Metal ostensibly challenges. </span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>Another way in which superegoic evil is significantly featured in Black Metal is through the ideological imperative of the Other. Satan plays a significant role as an emancipator in Black Metal, a restless and rebellious spirit who &#8216;hates&#8217; humanity. The ideology of Norwegian Black Metal is decidedly restless, interpreting Satan&#8217;s hatred of humanity as a hatred of how humanity has become subjectivized in ways that sever memory, history, legends, and ties to the landscape. It is a Symbolic severing that foregrounds this particular aspect of superegoic evil and in turn, it is through superegoic evil that such severance is reconciled. Whereas the Evangelical Lutheran God is an apt &#160;metonym for the Father of Prohibition, Satan might be seen oppositely as the Father of Permission, of freedom, and pleasure. In anthropologist Sam Dunn&#8217;s documentary, </span><span class="c1">Metal: A Headbanger&#8217;s Journey</span><span>, he interviews Gorgoroth &#8216;singer&#8217; Gaahl. In response to Dunn&#8217;s question &#8220;What do the church burnings mean to you?&#8221; Gaahl ponders, responding with a single word: &#8220;Satan.&#8221; &#160;When pressed further as to the connotations of Satan to the Black Metal subculture, Gaahl pauses momentarily before uttering &#8220;Freedom,&#8221; then drinking from a glass half full of conspicuously red liquid (Dunn, McFayden &amp; Rose, 2006). </span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>In another interview, Gorgoroth founder and guitarist Infurnus comments that the band&#8217;s music &#8220;is a homage to Satan through metal music&#8221; and further, that the band members &#160;are &#8220;Satan's humble servants on a quest for another human species&#8230; representant of the powers of Darkness in metal music&#8221; (Uncredited, 2005). &#160;If this is more than a simple fa&#231;ade, then it might be understood as indicative of a particular logic at work in superegoic instances of evil, &#160;that is, its reliance upon the maintenance of a Big Other. This Big Other supplies for Black Metal bands both a source of anti-Christian imagery and an ideological position from which to approach music making and performativity. For Gorgoroth&#8217;s lead singer, Gaahl, such associations are not simply limited to the stage, and in January of 2004 he was sentenced to a 14 month prison sentence for assaulting a man and reputedly threatening to drink his blood. In Black Metal, &#160;against the prohibitive edicts of the Evangelicals, Satan becomes a paternal figure of permissiveness, , a figure associated with freedom, irrepressibility, and the Imaginary distillation of evil that &#160;Gorgoroth&#8217;s music attempts to capture. &#160;As Infurnus suggests in a recent interview;</span></p><p class="c0 c13"><span>Black Metal is not another musical genre, and it is not a hobby or something you do for the fun of it. It is a life code and it implies a certain mentality and a outlook on life. Its meaningless to have a too strictly defined role as an artist opposed to the one of private life, as these do blend together and one way or another have relevance for the product being worked upon. Needless to say, as a Black Metal musician you have to be a Satanist. With the Satanic approach to life comes a set of goals, standards, and ethics which will always be there transcending and affecting whatever you relate to. That I choose metal to be the genre to work within simply can be explained as a matter of taste. &#160;(Uncredited, 2006)</span></p><p class="c13 c8 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>The case of Gorgoroth&#8217;s lead singer Gaahl seems closer to the idea of id evil developed by Zizek, &#160;that is, transgression as a corollary of </span><span class="c1">jouissance</span><span>. Yet, it is critical to note that as a Big Other, Satan does more than simply invite transgression. For the believer, transgression and revolution would be carried out as if an edict, as ethics with &#8216;goals&#8217; and &#8216;standards&#8217; (Uncredited, 2006). In this scenario, the Evangelical&#8217;s repressive God is inverted as a Satanic figure of permission. Yet, what remains untouched in this reversal is the vaunted position of the Big Other itself. It is in this manner that such Black Metal performers as Gorgoroth remain ideologically oriented through their relationship with Satan as a Big Other. This Big Other in turn provides the subject of Black Metal with identificatory coordinates confirming their position as infernal vassals. </span></p><p class="c5 c7 c0"><span>Zizek notes that the subject, &#160;in playing out such transgressions against universal ethical principles , , takes pleasure through knowing that an ideological cause has been served via the sacrifice of its &#160;own ethical status. Though some Black Metal bands do not condone church burning, they believe that it is an effective strategy against the privileged historical and religious history of Norway espoused by the Church. The burning of churches at the hands of pagans is &#160;a mirror of similar conflicts at the point of Norway&#8217;s conversion, when pagan churches were razed by Christians. The ideology of supegoic evil supported by Black Metal seems founded on a profound sense of judgment led by the marginalized. Satan is thus a critical figure to the phantasmagoric assailment of the Christian ethos as one who rises up against God, and is forever banished because of it. &#160;</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span class="c2">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ideological bearing of Black Metal is oriented toward the evocation of the darkest imaginary phantasmagoria possible as a means to grasp the completeness of the antagonism of which it is a symptom. As Infurnus comments elsewhere, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;I created Gorgoroth as a tool of manipulation, to bring up - it being live or in</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;studio&#8230;the most sinister energies working on the psyche of myself and others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; When in the spheres of psychodrama and magic[,] common sense and reason</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [are] not present&#8221;. Through Satan and Satanic practices, Infurnus suggests that</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; we might possess a kernel of the Real recuperated through the paradoxes of</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; magic and psychodramatic enactment of past trauma. Obvious here is the image</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; of Satan not as the suave and mustachioed seducer, but rather as a metaphorical</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;force, along &#8220;with other transgressive icons, the Devil is used to signify and</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;evoke in particular social contexts.&#8221; &#160;(Walser, 1993, p. 152) </span></p><p class="c8 c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span class="c2">Ostensibly, Gorgoroth and other Black Metal bands return to the Symbolic cut, and the moment of madness, mysticism, and the unknown that precedes both &#8216;the leap of faith&#8217; and reasoned subjectivity itself. In recuperating this moment of raw, &#8216;primitive,&#8217; and elemental force, a &#8216;full body&#8217; prior to Symbolic castration might be Imagined. In turn, the body of &#160;the Black Metal listener, described by some fans as &#8216;obliterated&#8217; or &#8220;slaughtered,&#8221; provides a psychic defense against the violence of the Symbolic apparatus. </span></p><p class="c5 c8 c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span class="c2 c11">Endnotes</span></p><p class="c5 c8 c0"><span class="c2 c11"></span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span class="c2">1 &#160;Vikernes first achieved media attention for the murder of former Mayhem bandmate and friend, Oystein Aarseth.
